Automate your WordPress Editorial Workflow with Oasis Workflow. Simple, intuitive drag and drop workflow builder to streamline your editorial process.

== Description ==

Oasis Workflow is a powerful feature rich plugin designed to automate any editorial workflow process using a simple, intuitive drag and drop interface.

= Typical users/audience for Oasis Workflow =
* WordPress sites with multiple authors that are looking to manage their content review and publication process more efficiently.
* Industries like healthcare, law firms, financial firms, universities, CPA firms, non-profits, news outlets and blogs, that publish articles regularly and need a formal review process.
* Industries with strict auditing requirements where they need to track who made the change, when was the change made and what was changed.

= The plugin provides three simple process/task templates: =
* Assignment - represents task related to content generation.
* Review - represents task related to content review.
* Publish - represents the actual "publish" or "review and publish" task.

**Visual Work flow Designer**
 - Configure your workflow using our easy drag and drop designer interface. See screen shots for more detail.

**Role-Based routing definitions allow you to assign tasks dynamically**
 - By using role-based routing, you can ensure that your process moves forward as quickly as possible without sacrificing accountability.

**Inbox**
 - Users can view their current assignments and sign off their tasks once it's completed.
 
**Custom Statuses**
 - Define custom statuses for your editorial workflow. With custom statuses you can define your own post statuses and assign it to the success or failure path of the workflow.

**Process history lets users retrace their steps**
 - For auditing purposes a record is created every time an article is routed through a workflow process. The process history also captures the comments added by the user during task sign off.

**Reassign - How to pass the buck?**
 - What if you have been assigned a workflow task, but you feel you are not the appropriate person to complete it? No worry, you can use the re-assign feature to pass the task to another person. 

**Due Date and Email reminders** help you to publish your articles on time.

**Out of the box workflow**
- To get you started, the plugin comes with two out of the box workflow - Single Level Review Workflow, and Multi Level Review Workflow. You can modify the workflow to suit your needs.

**If you are looking for additional functionality, check out our "Pro" version - Oasis Workflow Pro: https://www.oasisworkflow.com/pricing-purchase**
**It comes with additional features like,** 

* [Revise published content and add workflow support to revised content](https://www.oasisworkflow.com/documentation/working-with-workflows/revise-published-content) - Use workflow to edit your published content while keeping the published article online.
* [Auto Submit](https://www.oasisworkflow.com/documentation/working-with-workflows/auto-submit-to-workflow) - Allows you to automatically submit to workflow(s) with certain conditions.
